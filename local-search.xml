As for how I first got to know him, I still remember it. That happened in the 2007 season, Barcelona against Real Madrid, where 19 Messi scored his first career hat-trick.</p><p>Messi, whom we often know now, is the top player who has won 10 La Liga titles and 4 Champions League titles. But not many people know that when Messi was young, he almost gave up football because of a lack of growth hormone, but thanks to Barca’s timely intervention, which helped Messi pay for high treatment costs, the football player showed talent in the days to come. The fame and money that football brings has not addicted him to live a luxury and dissipation life. He is passionate about philanthropy and the construction of football in his hometown.</p><p>There are two reasons why l am interested in him. Firstly,l am obsessed with his superb football skills,which  is extremely watchable. Just like what l said before he is born for soccer. Secondly, his humility and unafraid of challenges inspire me. Peach and plum don’t say anything, but they are self-made<sup id="fnref:2" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--rounded" aria-label="桃李不言，下自成蹊">[2]</span></a></sup>.In the end, I sincerely wish him to win the FIFA World Cup Trophy<sup id="fnref:3" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--rounded" aria-label="大力神杯">[3]</span></a></sup> in this year.</p><iframe src="test1.pdf" width="800px" height="800px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><h3 id="Professor-Tang"><a href="#Professor-Tang" class="headerlink" title="Professor Tang"></a>Professor Tang</h3><p>l would like to talk about Professor Tang Yu. Perhaps he is not well known among the ordinary people of our country, but in our field of expertise he is a highly respected scholar. He is tall and slim, always wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses, a standard scholarly demeanor. The first time I met him was in my junior year of college, where he taught us a course on big data science and technology. </p><p>Like many academics, he also studied abroad at a young age. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, he chose to return to China and eventually came to our school to teach. He is fascinated by the front-end technology of big data science , published many papers at home and abroad, and won the first prize of national science and technology.</p><p>Although he is a long-established professor, he is humble in class. Since learning about big data for the first time, I often asked him questions. These questions that may seem like idiots to him, but he were patiently answered for me. At the same time, his profound knowledge also deeply influenced me, so that I finally chose the path of big data science, and he was the guide on my learning path.</p><section class="footnotes"><div class="footnote-list"><ol><li><span id="fn:1" class="footnote-text"><span>金球奖<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li><li><span id="fn:2" class="footnote-text"><span>桃李不言，下自成蹊<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li><li><span id="fn:3" class="footnote-text"><span>大力神杯<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li></ol></div></section>]]></content>
