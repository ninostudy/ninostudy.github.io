    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Topic"><a href="#Topic" class="headerlink" title="Topic"></a>Topic</h1><p>Today, more people are living longer after they retire from work. What problems will it cause for individuals and society? What can be done to prevent it?</p><h2 id="Writing"><a href="#Writing" class="headerlink" title="Writing"></a>Writing</h2><p><strong>Thanks</strong> to improved standards of medical treatment and health care,modern citizens are expected to live much longer after retirement than ever. Consequently,this may incur several repercussions on both individuals and society as a whole, and this thorny issue can be resolved promisingly.</p><p><strong>As</strong> for senior citizens,the leisure work-free life can be relaxing and refreshing for the first couple of years after retirement,but with the lapse of time, the lack of self-fulfillment from work can frequently cause boredom. Besides, as most of their children are wrapped up in their work, the senior left at home alone are very likely to lack companionship and suffer from empty-nest syndrome. And they may even feel abandoned by society as the technology is progressing so fast that they fail to adapt to such a fast-paced life.</p><p><strong>On</strong> the social level, the government ought to allocate more budgets to pensions and other welfare services like hospitals and nursing houses for the ensuring retirees’ wellbeing, which indicates a heavier  financial burden on society. The trend has been proved that, referring to countries like Japan, the proportion of labor force reduces over periods, the increased expenditure on social welfare and health care for longevity, as well as the burden shifted onto the shoulders of the youth as they each would have to support more aged citizens.</p><p><strong>Given</strong> the gravity of these problems, two schemes can be put on the agenda. The first imperative approach is that the government can issue corresponding policies, such as raising the age of retirement, or encourage companies to reemploy those experienced senior workers. Taking full advantage of their abundant experience in workplace, the elderly can help to train new employees who lack relevant experience, which not only gives the old a sense of fulfilment but also alleviates the financial burden of the government to some extent. Additionally, communities can arrange a variety of activities for the senior community members. For instance, easy tasks like putting up notices can be assigned, which will make the old feel that they can still make contributions to the community.</p><p><strong>To</strong> recapitulate, since possible effects and feasible remedies have been enumerated, this crisis can be handled with joint efforts of both the government and communities.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Topic"><a href="#Topic" class="headerlink" title="Topic"></a>Topic</h1><p>With the increasing demand for energy such as oil and gas, people start to look for their sources in remote and untouched places. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?</p><h2 id="Writing"><a href="#Writing" class="headerlink" title="Writing"></a>Writing</h2><p>Global demand for energy is increasing rapidly due to population and economic growth. In order to meet these challenges, some suggest to find oil and gas in remote and untouched areas. Despite some environmental repercussions, I believe the benefits of this exploration are more significant.</p><p>I understand the environmental concerns raised by some people. They think that the local ecosystem would be destroyed. For example, the debate over whether to drill for energy in the Arctic and Antarctic has exited for more than a decade simply because of its possible disastrous impact. Drilling there would directly destroy the habitat of animals, such as polar bears and penguins to begin with. What is worse, a wider scale of energy exploration means over-dependence on fossil resources. Global warming and other climate problems have deteriorated to tipping point.</p><p>Nevertheless, these worries should not be overstated as the international community is fully aware of potential danger and in turn well prepared with relevant resolutions. There are already regulations and laws restricting reckless exploitation at both national and international levels, meaning that the risk and impacts could be meticulously monitored and kept at an acceptable level. As for global warming, we can solve it by developing new types of clean energy. For example, there is a large amount of solar energy for electric power generation, and thousands of wind turbines have also been erected in vast Grassland of Inner Mongolia for power energy. Through these new sustainable energy sources, we can reduce carbon emissions and achieve a low-carbon life.</p><p>Not to mention that if people stop exploring new sources of energy, it will trigger an economic crisis and even more serious social problems. The coming shortage could drive the price to high level that both people and companies are unable to afford. What comes next might be more severe problems that cloud threaten the normal function of society. Just like last winter, the Texas black out event caused 40% of the local residents to lose power. At the same time, Texas energy supplier Griddy had soared electricity prices from $50 per kilowatt-hour in the same period last year to more than $9000 per kilowatt-hour. And this caused a series of social problems.</p><p>In conclusion, with the consideration of economy and environment ,seeking for new sources in remote place has more benefits than disadvantages , both short-term and long-term.</p>]]></content>

As for how I first got to know him, I still remember it. That happened in the 2007 season, Barcelona against Real Madrid, where 19 Messi scored his first career hat-trick.</p><p>Messi, whom we often know now, is the top player who has won 10 La Liga titles and 4 Champions League titles. But not many people know that when Messi was young, he almost gave up football because of a lack of growth hormone, but thanks to Barca’s timely intervention, which helped Messi pay for high treatment costs, the football player showed talent in the days to come. The fame and money that football brings has not addicted him to live a luxury and dissipation life. He is passionate about philanthropy and the construction of football in his hometown.</p><p>There are two reasons why l am interested in him. Firstly,l am obsessed with his superb football skills,which  is extremely watchable. Just like what l said before he is born for soccer. Secondly, his humility and unafraid of challenges inspire me.

Perhaps he is not well known among the ordinary people of our country, but in our field of expertise he is a highly respected scholar. He is tall and slim, always wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses, a standard scholarly demeanor. The first time I met him was in my junior year of college, where he taught us a course on big data science and technology. </p><p>Like many academics, he also studied abroad at a young age. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, he chose to return to China and eventually came to our school to teach. He is fascinated by the front-end technology of big data science , published many papers at home and abroad, and won the first prize of national science and technology.</p><p>Although he is a long-established professor, he is humble in class. Since learning about big data for the first time, I often asked him questions. These questions that may seem like idiots to him, but he were patiently answered for me. At the same time, his profound knowledge also deeply influenced me, so that I finally chose the path of big data science, and he was the guide on my learning path.</p><section class="footnotes"><div class="footnote-list"><ol><li><span id="fn:1" class="footnote-text"><span>金球奖<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li><li><span id="fn:2" class="footnote-text"><span>桃李不言，下自成蹊<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li><li><span id="fn:3" class="footnote-text"><span>大力神杯<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li></ol></div></section>]]></content>
